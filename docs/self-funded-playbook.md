## 1. The Cash Machine Mindset

**Source:** Cohen #1

The goal is a business that predictably and repeatedly generates profit every month. Not a one-off sale, not a hope, not a maybe. A machine where you put money in one end and more comes out the other.

**How this applies to Rekan:** Rekan's recurring WhatsApp service model is inherently a cash machine. Each client pays monthly. The question is not "will we have revenue next month" but "how many clients will still be paying." Every pricing and acquisition decision should be evaluated through this lens: does it make the machine more predictable?

## 2. Revenue Model

### 2.1 Recurring revenue is non-negotiable

**Source:** Cohen #1

One-off revenue means starting from scratch every month. Cohen ran SmartBear with millions in revenue and still woke up panicked about payroll because each month was a reset. Recurring revenue is the only model that lets you sleep.

**Rekan:** Already recurring. Monthly service via WhatsApp.

### 2.2 The 150 customers formula

**Source:** Cohen #1

Forget "1,000 true fans" (Kevin Kelly redacted it). 150 customers at ~$70/month = $10k/month. 150 is achievable. 1,000 is not, at least not quickly.

**Rekan:** Needs only ~21 clients at R$108.90 for Elenice's R$2,000/month target. The bar is even lower. But the formula still matters: as we grow, 150 Parceiro clients = R$16,335/month. That's a real business.

### 2.3 Charge more than feels comfortable

**Source:** Cohen #1

"A lot of self-funded founders realize their product doesn't have a lot of features and it's kind of shitty and the support is slow because it's just you and everything about it is kind of shitty and so they feel like they shouldn't charge a lot. That's not a good idea."

Cohen doubled a company from $19 to $49/month. Signups didn't change. Then he told them to double again.

**Rekan:** R$108.90 is already well-positioned in the pricing gap (above DIY tools, far below SMMs). But the instinct to lower prices "because we're small" must be resisted. The boutique framing justifies premium pricing. See PEP-010.

### 2.4 Three tiers, highlight the middle

**Source:** Cohen #1 (via Erica Douglas)

- Bottom tier: exists to make the middle look obvious
- Middle tier: highlighted, this is what you want people to buy
- Top tier: named "Business" or "Professional" because business owners self-select into it

The top tier also anchors the price. Even if nobody buys it, it makes the middle feel reasonable.

**Rekan:** See PEP-010 tier structure (Basico / Parceiro / Profissional).

### 2.5 Strikethrough pricing

**Source:** Cohen #1

"We wrote $79, crossed it out, and said $49. Sales went up." The same product, the same price, but now it feels like a deal.

Also: charge $99/month but give bloggers/affiliates a 30% coupon. Everyone feels like they're getting a deal, you still average what you need.

**Rekan:** The "preco de lançamento" strikethrough on Parceiro (~~R$149.90~~ R$108.90). See PEP-010.

### 2.6 Don't pick up pennies

**Source:** Cohen #1

Avoid revenue models where you scrape a tiny percentage off transactions (Kickstarter did $100M in funding but only made $6M, not enough to cover costs). Charge customers directly, charge them a lot.

**Rekan:** Direct B2B service. No marketplace, no transaction fees, no pennies. Good.

---

## 3. Cash Flow

### 3.1 Annual/quarterly prepay

**Source:** Cohen #1

"You have to use the annual prepaid trick. It's required by law."

Give 2 months free on annual. You collect 16% less over a year but you get all the cash NOW. WP Engine: 25% of signups chose annual, giving 3x the first-month cash flow. This meant they collected more cash monthly than they spent on acquisition. "The marketing budget is not limited by money."

Capital Factory hack: raise the monthly price, make the annual discount absurdly large. $49/month but annual at half off. "Signups didn't change at all. Everyone was perfectly happy to see a higher monthly price and get a much bigger annual discount."

**Rekan:** Annual is too large for MEIs (~R$1,300). Adapted to trimestral (R$299.70). See PEP-010 Wave 2.

### 3.2 Coupons that only work on longer commitments

**Source:** Cohen #1

Give affiliates a coupon: "3 months free if you sign up annual." The coupon only works on annual. You're giving 2 months free anyway (the normal annual discount), so 3 months is barely more. But it's a big incentive to commit long-term and a big cash bump.

**Rekan:** Referral and ad coupons (R$19.90 first month) only on trimestral. See PEP-010 Wave 3.

---

## 4. Pricing Psychology

### 4.1 Money-back guarantee over free trial

**Source:** Cohen #1

"I hate free trials for bootstrap companies because you never get that money back."

WP Engine switched from 15-day free trial to 60-day money-back guarantee. Charge full price from day 1, offer generous refund window. Signups went UP. People emailed: "15 days didn't seem like enough time. Now that I have 60 days, I decided to sign up." Almost nobody asked for the refund.

Key insight: more time = more signups. And you collect real money on day 1.

**Rekan:** Adopted the 30-day money-back guarantee as the default entry (PEP-010). Full price from day 1, "devolvo tudo pelo Pix" if not satisfied. 30 days (not 60) because Rekan's value is visible within the first week (content delivered in days, not weeks like hosting migration). The R$19.90 first month survives only as a coupon for cold ad traffic on trimestral plans.

### 4.2 Daily price reframing

Reframe monthly cost in daily terms. R$108.90/month = R$3.60/day. "Less than a coffee." Makes any monthly number feel small.

**Rekan:** Already in the renewal script ("Menos de R$4 por dia"). Should be in every pricing touchpoint.

### 4.3 Anchor against the real alternative

Never let the customer compare your price to "free" (doing nothing). Always anchor against what they'd otherwise pay: a social media manager at R$590+/month.

**Rekan:** See PEP-010 cardapio design. Anchor line at the top of every pricing conversation.

### 4.4 Boutique sympathy

**Source:** Cohen #1

"If you say 'I am just one person who's really making a go of it,' that actually lets you charge more money. People think that's awesome. Startups are cool right now."

A boutique is a shop with one or two people, super expensive, barely ever open. But you get incredible attention, the work is amazing and unique, and you feel good helping them out. You don't mind paying 3x because it's special.

**Rekan:** Elenice IS this. A solo founder building something personal. The "preco de lançamento" framing leans into boutique sympathy. The WhatsApp-first delivery IS boutique: you're not a faceless app, you're a person who knows your name and your business.

### 4.5 ARPU is the north star when small

**Source:** Cohen #1

"The amount of money you're charging per customer is the most important metric in your company. More important than cancellation rate even, when you're small."

Moving ARPU up by R$20 across 20 clients = R$400/month. That's equivalent to acquiring 4 new Basico clients, with zero acquisition cost.

**Rekan:** Track ARPU monthly. Every pricing change should be evaluated by its impact on ARPU.

## 5. Market Selection

### 5.1 B2B always, never B2C

**Source:** Cohen #1

"Consumers don't spend money on stuff." Gmail couldn't charge $5/month. App Store reviews complain about $1.99. Every successful self-funded company Cohen knows is B2B.

**Rekan:** Sells to MEIs (micro businesses). Correct side.

### 5.2 Continuous pain, not temporary

**Source:** Cohen #1

Avoid businesses where the pain is temporary (weddings, events, one-time fixes). You have to catch the customer at the exact right moment and the need doesn't recur.

Prefer: pain that's naturally ongoing. Costs that recur (hosting), cycles that repeat (invoicing, taxes), domains that change (SEO, social media, content marketing).

**Rekan:** Instagram content is continuous, ongoing, and gets worse the longer you ignore it. The "vergonha" (guilt/shame) of not posting compounds over time. Textbook recurring pain.

### 5.3 Not real-time

**Source:** Cohen #1

Avoid products where the customer needs something from you RIGHT NOW or it's over (hosting: site down at 3am). Prefer things that can wait until morning (invoicing, analytics, content).

**Rekan:** Content delivery through WhatsApp is inherently async. A confeiteira sends a message about her cake, gets content back within hours. No 3am emergencies. Ideal.

### 5.4 Aftermarket for existing platforms

**Source:** Cohen #1

Build on top of something people already use. SmartBear built code review on top of version control systems. WP Engine built hosting on top of WordPress. Balsamiq started as a Basecamp add-on.

Benefits: the customer base already exists, keywords are obvious, the platform vendor often wants to support you.

**Rekan:** Aftermarket for Instagram. 160M active social media users in Brazil. We're not convincing anyone to use Instagram, we're helping them use it better.

### 5.5 Big market for optionality

**Source:** Cohen #1

Big markets give you room to pivot niches if the first one fails. Confeitaria doesn't work? Try nails, hair, personal trainers. 15.6M MEIs in Brazil means there's always another segment.

"Optionality is always power."

**Rekan:** The MEI market is enormous. Niche-first (confeitaria) but expandable. See PEP-009 Wave 3.

### 5.6 Avoid marketplaces and viral-dependent growth

**Source:** Cohen #1

Marketplaces are two businesses (buyers + sellers) that both need to succeed simultaneously. Viral coefficients almost never work at small scale.

**Rekan:** Direct service, one customer at a time. No marketplace, no viral dependency. Good.

### 5.7 Product that can be "done"

**Source:** Cohen #1

Prefer products that don't require endless feature development to stay competitive. WinZip was "done" and made $1M/year. Avoid feature wars with better-funded competitors.

**Rekan:** The AI pipeline is the product, not the features. Competitors (GalilAI) compete on features. Rekan competes on relationship + zero friction. The pipeline improves but the core offering (send message, get content) is already done.

## 6. Customer Acquisition

### 6.1 Scratch and claw to first 50

**Source:** Cohen #1

Cohen found 30-40 people who agreed to pay $50/month for WP Engine before he had a company name, a presentation, employees, or a server. The technique: reach out respectfully, offer to pay for their time, talk about their pain. 100% response rate, 0% asked for money.

"If you can't scrape together [50 customers] over a period of months, then it's gonna be hard to make this a company ever."

**Rekan:** Elenice's network + WhatsApp groups + local businesses + Sebrae events. The first 5-10 come from personal connections. The next 10-20 from disciplined outreach.

### 6.2 Social media is unreliable for acquisition

**Source:** Cohen #1

"I have a blog with 40,000 readers. When I launched WP Engine, I got 2 signups." Heaton Shaw confirmed: "No, it's always like that. It doesn't work. Move on."

Social media can work if you spend tons of time on it (like Buffer), but it's not a predictable cash machine input.

**Rekan caveat:** Cohen's context is English-speaking SaaS for developers. Rekan's audience lives on Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta ads (PEP-009) are paid acquisition through social platforms, which is different from organic social. The @chamaorekan grid exists for credibility, not as a primary acquisition channel.

### 6.3 Cost per click formula

**Source:** Cohen #1

Rule of thumb: max cost per click = average monthly revenue per customer / 25.

R$108.90 / 25 = R$4.35 per click. Rekan uses cost-per-WhatsApp-conversation instead (R$5-8 target), which is higher intent than a website click. The math works differently but the principle holds: know your number.

### 6.4 Affiliates work if you pay them well

**Source:** Cohen #1

Most affiliate programs pay ~$30. That gets no attention. WP Engine paid $200-300 per referral. "If you're charging a lot of money, you can pay the affiliate a lot. See, isn't it better to charge a lot of money? It opens up options."

Couple affiliate payouts with annual/quarterly prepay coupons to manage cash flow.

Caution: "There's a lot of shady affiliates. If you go to an affiliate conference, you feel like you need to take a bath afterwards." Vet affiliates to protect brand reputation.

**Rekan:** The referral program (PEP-010 Wave 3) is Rekan's version of affiliates. Pay referrers well (1 month free, not 1 week). Confeiteiras referring other confeiteiras is the most natural and trusted channel.

### 6.5 Land and expand

**Source:** Cohen #1 (Q&A section)

SmartBear's average first transaction was $12k. Average total lifetime transaction was $60k. Get in with a small commitment, deliver value, expand over time.

**Rekan:** Basico (R$69.90) or Parceiro (R$108.90) as entry. Upsell to Profissional (R$249.90) after 2-3 months of demonstrated results. Zero acquisition cost on the upgrade.

## 7. The Success Dilemma

**Source:** Cohen #1

"If it keeps growing and you don't hire people for support, you're going to give bad customer service. And if you do hire more people, now you're managing people instead of building."

The hardest thing (Thales): "Know thyself." What are you building this for? What will be fulfilling? That answer changes over time.

**Rekan:** At 20+ clients, Elenice shifts from sales mode to operations mode. At 40+, she's overloaded without Phase 2 automation. The whatsmeow bot is the answer, but even with automation, the nature of her work changes. This needs explicit planning, not just "solve it when you get there."

Options Cohen lists: sell the company, raise prices to reduce volume, raise money and swing for the fences, or accept the evolution. For Rekan, the natural evolution is Option 4 from BUSINESS.md: sell the pipeline to other social media managers (B2B of B2B). That lets Elenice stay in the relationship role while the product scales without her being the bottleneck for every client.

## 8. Mindset

### 8.1 Self-funded, not "bootstrapped" or "lifestyle"

**Source:** Cohen #1 (via Heaton Shaw)

"Lifestyle business" is pejorative. "Bootstrap" is vague. Call it self-funded. Maybe a little friends-and-family money, maybe a little debt, but not giving up significant equity.

### 8.2 Stay true to what feels right

**Source:** Cohen #1

"I always regret not following what I think is the right thing. How to treat people coming in, coming out. The standards you set for yourself, your customers, your product."

**Rekan:** The boutique/partner positioning IS the identity. Don't compromise it for growth shortcuts (spammy affiliates, desperate discounting, over-promising).

### 8.3 Fire fast

**Source:** Cohen #1

"No one ever says 'we fired that person too quickly.' Everyone has a story of when they didn't fire someone soon enough." Usually cultural, not skills-based.

**Rekan:** Applies to problematic clients too. A client who constantly complains, demands more than they pay for, or is disrespectful to Elenice costs more in energy than they bring in revenue. Let them go.
