# PEP-009: Meta Ads Strategy

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-02-24

## Context

Rekan is a boutique content partner for Brazilian MEIs, delivered via WhatsApp. Three tiers: Basico R$69.90, Parceiro R$108.90 (founder discount from R$149.90), Profissional R$249.90. All plans include a 30-day money-back guarantee. Everyone gets the same offer, no special coupons for any channel. Organic growth through Elenice's network will get the first 5-10 clients, but paid acquisition through Meta Ads is the scalable channel.

The opportunity: Meta's click-to-WhatsApp ad objective sends people directly into a WhatsApp conversation with Elenice. No landing page, no funnel, no friction. The ad IS the top of funnel, WhatsApp IS the sales floor.

The challenge: most small businesses burn money on ads because they target too broadly and use generic creatives. Rekan's advantage is that we know exactly who the customer is (working MEI in a specific niche) and we can build creatives that self-select for that person.

### Positioning constraint

Rekan is premium for the MEI market. Not the cheap option, not a tool. A boutique content partner. Ads must reflect this: demonstrate expertise and empathy, not discount energy.

### Niche-first approach

Per BUSINESS.md, we start with one vertical (confeitaria is the strongest candidate given Elenice's network and the richest targeting signals). Expand to nails/hair after proving the playbook.

## Wave 1: Foundation (pre-ads)

Everything that needs to exist before spending R$1 on ads.

- [ ] Seed @chamaorekan grid with 9-12 posts using the hybrid checkerboard pattern (branded cards + raw photos alternating). People who see the ad will tap through to the profile; a sparse grid kills credibility.
- [ ] Set up Meta Business Suite: connect @chamaorekan Instagram Business account + Rekan WhatsApp Business number. This unlocks the click-to-WhatsApp ad objective.
- [ ] Create a Custom Audience from @chamaorekan profile visitors and engagers (automatic once Business Suite is connected and pixel is active).
- [ ] Prepare 3-4 ad creatives for confeitaria niche (see Creative Brief below).
- [ ] Elenice tests the WhatsApp response flow: when someone messages from an ad, she has a greeting + qualification script ready ("Oi! Voce e confeiteira? Me conta um pouco do seu trabalho que eu te mostro como funciona.").

**Gate:** Business Suite connected, WhatsApp linked, grid has 9+ posts, 3 creatives ready to upload.

## Wave 2: First Campaign (confeitaria)

Launch, measure, iterate over 2-3 weeks.

- [ ] Create campaign with "Messages" objective (click-to-WhatsApp). One campaign, two ad sets:
  - **Ad Set A (niche interest):** Location: Elenice's city + 30km. Age 25-55. Interests layered: confeitaria supply accounts (@lojasantoantonio, @magoindustria, Mago, Santo Antonio) + business education (Sebrae, @raphafalcaof, marketing digital para negocios). Budget: R$10-15/day.
  - **Ad Set B (retargeting):** @chamaorekan profile visitors, post engagers, people who opened WhatsApp but didn't send a message. Budget: R$5/day.
- [ ] Run for 5 days without touching anything. Let Meta's algorithm optimize delivery.
- [ ] Day 5 check: kill any creative with cost per WhatsApp conversation > R$10 after R$50 spent. Double budget on anything under R$5.
- [ ] Week 2: add 1-2 new creatives to replace killed ones. Test different angles (pain vs. demonstration vs. social proof).
- [ ] Week 3: if 20+ WhatsApp contacts collected, build 1% Lookalike audience from their phone numbers. Add as Ad Set C.

**Gate:** Cost per WhatsApp conversation consistently under R$8. At least 15 conversations started. Elenice has converted at least 2 into paying clients (full price + 30-day guarantee).

## Wave 3: Playbook + Niche Expansion

Once confeitaria is proven, document what worked and replicate.

- [ ] Document the winning creative format, copy angle, and audience configuration as a repeatable playbook.
- [ ] Adapt creatives for second niche (nails or hair, based on Elenice's preference). Replace confeitaria-specific imagery and pain points with niche equivalents.
- [ ] Launch second niche campaign using the same structure (interest + retargeting ad sets).
- [ ] Set up monthly creative refresh cadence: 2-3 new creatives per month to combat audience fatigue.

**Gate:** Two niches running with cost per conversation under R$10. Playbook documented.

## Creative Brief

### Format
All creatives 9:16 vertical. Instagram Reels + Stories placement only (cheapest CPMs, where MEIs scroll).

### Creative 1: "O post que voce nao fez hoje"
Static. Raw aesthetic: phone on messy counter, Instagram open with empty caption field, flour on screen, time showing late at night. Text overlay: "Voce trabalhou 12 horas. Agora tem que pensar em legenda." No logo, no price, no CTA in the image. The pain self-selects the audience. CTA in ad copy: "A Rekan cuida disso pra voce. Chama no WhatsApp."

### Creative 2: "2 minutos"
Screen recording of a real WhatsApp exchange. MEI sends a quick text about a cake delivery. Timer shows 2 minutes. Complete content package comes back. No explanation, just the raw evidence it works. Premium services demonstrate, they don't explain.

### Creative 3: "Sua concorrente posta todo dia"
Split screen. Left: a competitor's consistent Instagram grid. Right: the target's grid, last post 3 weeks ago. Text: "Ela nao e melhor que voce. Ela so tem alguem cuidando do conteudo." Hits competitive anxiety without being aggressive.

### Creative 4: "Cliente real" (once available)
Elenice selfie video, 30 seconds, no script. Tells one real client story: "A [nome] me mandou a foto do bolo as 10h. As 10:02 ja tinha o post pronto. Postou na hora do almoco, recebeu 3 mensagens de cliente nova."

### Copy guidelines
- Partner voice, not vendor voice. "Voce faz o que sabe fazer. O Instagram, deixa com a gente."
- Lead with the problem or the result, never with features.
- Price only in retargeting (they already know what Rekan is). In prospecting, the CTA is just "Chama no WhatsApp."

## Metrics

| Metric | Target | Kill threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Cost per WhatsApp conversation | < R$5 (good), < R$8 (acceptable) | > R$10 after R$50 spent |
| Conversation to trial rate | > 15% | < 5% (fix the WhatsApp script) |
| Trial to paying rate | > 40% | < 20% (fix the onboarding) |
| Monthly creative refresh | 2-3 new creatives | Stale = rising CPAs |

## Value Proof Strategy

Ads bring people in. Proof keeps them paying. MEIs don't track metrics, so traditional ROI arguments don't work. The proof must be visual, concrete, and felt.

### The real competitor is inertia, not GalilAI

A confeiteira isn't comparing R$108.90 to GalilAI's R$28. She's comparing it to doing nothing, which is free. The value proof must make the "before Rekan" state feel painful and the "after Rekan" state feel obvious.

### Proof mechanisms (zero-cost, built into the service)

1. **Monthly grid screenshot.** During Elenice's check-in, screenshot the client's Instagram grid and send it back. "Olha como ficou seu perfil esse mes. Lembra como tava antes?" The difference is visual, no analytics needed.

2. **Posting frequency message.** "Esse mes voce postou 12 vezes. Antes do Rekan, eram 2." Simple comparison that hits instantly.

3. **"Pergunta pro cliente" prompt.** During onboarding, suggest the MEI ask new customers "como voce me achou?" If two people say "pelo Instagram," that's more convincing than any chart.

4. **Peer stories in WhatsApp.** When delivering content, Elenice occasionally adds: "Esse tipo de post funcionou muito bem pra outra confeiteira, teve muita mensagem no direct." Informal, peer-based, costs nothing.

### The day-20 check-in

No price transition to manage (client pays full price from day 1 with 30-day guarantee). The check-in reinforces value and nudges toward trimestral:

> "Oi [nome], esse mes voce postou [X] vezes no Instagram. Olha como seu perfil ta ficando consistente. Sabia que no plano trimestral o preco cai pra R$99,90/mes? Se quiser garantir, e so me falar."

Three things: reminds of value received, shows the trimestral upgrade path, keeps it casual.

### The vergonha angle

The most underexploited motivator. Most MEIs feel embarrassed about their Instagram. They know they should post. They see competitors posting. Every time they open the app and see their last post was 3 weeks ago, they feel guilt. Rekan sells the end of that guilt. "Nunca mais fica sem postar." Creatives 1 and 3 in the brief above tap directly into this.

## Consequences

- Monthly ad spend of R$450-600 becomes a fixed cost. At target CPA (R$5/conversation, 15% conversion), that's ~15-20 trials/month for R$450.
- Elenice needs to handle ad-sourced conversations promptly. A lead from an ad goes cold fast; same-day response is critical.
- Creative production becomes ongoing work. 2-3 new creatives per month, mostly variations of winning formats.
- The Instagram grid must stay active. Ads drive profile visits; a stale grid wastes ad spend.
- The proof mechanisms (grid screenshots, frequency messages, day-20 renewal message) become part of Elenice's monthly routine per client. Low effort but must be consistent.
